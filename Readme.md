# Layout frame experiment

## Motivation

The motation of this experiment is to figure out how we can provide a pure
layouting component in a microfrontend environment that is a dumb and
lightweight as can be. In order to make integration effort low, while still
maintaining developer friendless this project to stay buildless for the
layouting component.


## How to run

Just open `src/index.html` to open a test displayment of the component to easily
develop in the browser.

## Building

As this project is intended to run buildless the only build step necessary is to
package it into an npm package to be consumed by another application. For this
it should be enough to run:

``` shell

```
